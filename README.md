# BurgerShop
This is a Full Stack application using MySQL DataBase, handlebars, javascript, NodeJS (using Express), CSS and HTML.


# How it works

By using the supplied Schema and seed data you can launch the NodeJS application to start the server running and then naviate to the localhost and port on your machine to interact with the data.

You can enter a new burger of your choice and add it to the database. It will then render the burger on the page using handlebars. You can click the devour button next to any of the burgers on the screen and it will then move that burger to the other side of the page and change the value of devoured in your database to true.
